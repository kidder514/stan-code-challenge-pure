## how to set up 
 1. install dependency  
```npm install```
 2. run the local build  
```npm start```   
 3. if you want to build the file, run     
```npm run build```
4. run the unit test
```npm run test```

## what I have done 
1. set up the project from scratch without using create-react-app, let it output the correct file during the build.   
2. set up Jest and testing-library/react scratch.
3. build basic layout, set up redux tooltip. react-router, 
4. set up css reset and global style. Use rem as css unit as it ll make the mobile responsiveness work easier.
5. build the carousel component as reusable component.
6. program selecting using keyboard, carousel sliding animation.
7. build program page
8. connect program page with carousel using keyboard event and routing
9. allow program page to be refreshed. 
10. add unit testing.

## if I have more time, I will
1. add more unit test
2. add more E2E test
3. let Carousel handle more props. like column, aspectRatio, showTitle,
7. browser compatibility check
9. optimize rerendering.
